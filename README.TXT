This is a very simple project to demonstrate some characteristics of
objects.

This project is often used after studying the "shapes" project. It
adds a class to those ones in "shapes". That class (named "Picture")
uses the shapes to draw a picture. It can be used to experiment with 
modifying source code.

For 2 suns I sent a picture in the files aswell as if you go to Picture file, you
can reenable the code simply by making the second sun visible. The current code that is activated represents the sunset code.
